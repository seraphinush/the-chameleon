# Story
You are Pierre - a newly recruited agent of the Wizard Hazard Avoidance Taskforce (WHAT). The WHAT is an organization that has historically protected the flow of reality from being altered. All ordinary humans are able to enjoy a stable reality thanks to the dedicated members of the WHAT. Yet, nobody knows about the existence of the organization because the information could prove too dangerous for the general public. This is why the wizards of WHAT have perfected the art of stealth by blending their appearances to the surroundings. They are effectively invisible. As the newest member of this prestigious taskforce you also are able to sneak into every corner of the world completely undetected… most of the time.

Why were you recruited? Necessity.

Should you have been recruited? Debatable.

Were you really recruited? Pretty sure.

The fact is, reality is in danger once again. A group that we have identified as “The Shades” has stolen five ancient Mayan artifacts and used them to erase all well-known and capable members of WHAT from existence. Thankfully, you are still here - because you weren’t one of those. With this incredible power on The Shades hands the world could spiral into chaos. 

The five treasures of the Mayans are all located at different facilities, hidden in museums, government strongholds, and ancient temples. The Shades are heavily guarding their treasures. You must recover them and use their power to bring back WHAT in force to save the world. You can’t mess this one up. If you’re caught the world will never be the same.
